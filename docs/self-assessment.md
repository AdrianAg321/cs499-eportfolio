Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have developed a strong technical foundation while learning to approach problems more strategically and with greater confidence. Completing the coursework and building my ePortfolio helped me recognize the strengths I bring to software development, data management, and system design. It also gave me a clearer understanding of how my academic training connects with my professional background in supply chain and logistics. Together, these experiences support my long-term goal of becoming a data analyst.

One central area of growth came from collaborating in team-based environments. Whether I was coordinating responsibilities during database projects or troubleshooting programming issues with classmates. I learned the importance of clear communication and shared problem-solving. These experiences helped me become more comfortable explaining my decisions, asking for clarification when needed, and offering constructive feedback. Over time, I developed more substantial confidence working in team settings, which aligns well with the collaborative nature of both software development and supply chain operations.

Communication with stakeholders became another key skill I strengthened. Many courses required translating technical concepts. For example, I learned how to explain technical concepts such as CRUD operations, hashing, or tree traversal in a way that non-technical users can easily understand. This ability has been invaluable in my professional life, where I often interpret data trends or operational issues for coworkers with varying technical backgrounds. The capstone reinforced this skill by requiring me to clearly explain each enhancement and how it improved the original implementation.

My understanding of data structures and algorithms also expanded significantly. Earlier courses introduced the fundamentals, but projects like the CS 300 Binary Search Tree pushed me to apply them in functional, real-world programs. Implementing the BST, managing pointers, and writing traversal and deletion operations strengthened my algorithmic thinking and debugging abilities. This experience ties directly into data analysis, where efficiency and accuracy are essential to how data is processed and interpreted.

Software engineering principles remained a consistent theme throughout the program. Working on larger projects, including the CS 340 CRUD module and the CS 465 full-stack application, taught me how to structure my code and manage dependencies. These projects also helped me improve my documentation habits and understand best practices for maintainable software. These skills translate naturally into my supply chain role, where structured workflows and clear procedures are essential to system reliability and operational accuracy.

I also gained valuable hands-on experience with databases and security. Working with MongoDB, designing schemas, writing queries, and resolving connection issues helped me understand how modern applications manage and protect data. Topics such as credential handling, input validation, and secure communication increased my awareness of system risks and reinforced the importance of building solutions that are both functional and safe. These lessons are especially meaningful as I move toward data-focused roles where accuracy and security are critical.

As I assembled my ePortfolio, I selected artifacts that represent the range of skills I’ve developed. The enhanced CS 340 CRUD module demonstrates my ability to work with databases, apply secure coding practices, and write well-structured Python. The CS 300 Binary Search Tree highlights my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and system behavior. Together, these artifacts show a balanced set of capabilities that support both software development and data analysis.

Overall, revisiting, enhancing, and explaining these artifacts helped me reflect on how far I’ve come in the program. It strengthened my confidence as I prepare to enter the field and gave me a clearer sense of how to communicate my abilities to future employers. My academic work, combined with six years of experience in supply chain and logistics, has helped me grow into a more analytical, detail-oriented, and technically capable professional. The capstone experience brought these strengths together and reinforced my readiness to contribute meaningfully in technical roles, particularly in data analysis and systems development.
